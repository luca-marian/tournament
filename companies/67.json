    "round_4": "The Massachusetts Maple Producers association is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1947 to promote and preserve the maple sugaring industry in Massachusetts. The association represents most of the commercial and hobbyist sugarmaking in the state and supports ongoing research into the factors affecting its members' farms, including production practices, quality control, environmental concerns, land development pressures, and long-term tree health. While the association does not conduct inspections, it disseminates information to its members to help them maintain strong quality control and assist with specific problems as needed. The organization also acts as the industry's representative to both state and federal governments on specific legislative issues that affect maple producers. The funds for the association come from a small commission on discounted containers and supplies, as well as membership dues, and the association is governed by a nine-member Board of Directors elected yearly by the general membership.",
